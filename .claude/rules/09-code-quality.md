# Reference: Code Quality

Write code that is **simple, maintainable, and production-ready**. Prioritize clarity over cleverness.

## Principles

1. **Simplicity First** (KISS)
2. **Consistency** in tech stack
3. **Maintainability** over cleverness
4. **DRY** — eliminate duplication
5. **YAGNI** — don't add speculative features
6. **SOLID** — Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion

## Code Organization

- Keep functions small (< 20 lines ideally, < 100 lines max)
- One level of abstraction per function
- Use meaningful, pronounceable names
- Self-documenting code; comments explain "why", not "what"
- Prefer composition over inheritance

## Error Handling

- Fail fast and explicitly
- Use typed errors/exceptions with clear messages
- Never silently ignore errors
- Validate inputs at system boundaries

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- No commented-out code "just in case"
- No TODO comments
- No copy-paste instead of abstracting
- No premature optimization
- No over-engineering simple solutions
- No ignoring compiler/linter warnings
