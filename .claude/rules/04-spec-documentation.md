# Step 3: Spec Documentation

**Skip on `main` branch and for trivial changes.**

On feature branches, run `/sync-spec-kit` to update the spec folder after implementing changes.

- The spec folder is the **single source of truth** for what was built in the feature branch
- Every change must be reflected in the spec — bug fixes, new functionality, adjustments
- When the user reports a bug or requests a change: first implement it, then update the spec
